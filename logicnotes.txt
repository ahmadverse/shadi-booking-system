📅 Day 1 - Logic Journal

✅ What I built:
- Flask To-Do App

🔍 What logic I saw:
- If `tasks` is not empty, show the list
- For each `task`, show its title and delete link
- `POST` adds task, `GET` deletes it

🧠 Why this matters:
- This is how every app works — input ➜ logic ➜ output
- I finally saw how Python logic connects to HTML using Jinja2




📅 Day 2 - Logic Journal

✅ What I built:
- Web Calculator App (Flask)

🔍 What logic I saw:
- Inputs sent using HTML <form> POST method
- Flask receives input → uses logic (if-elif-else)
- Function-like structure decides the result

🧠 Why this matters:
- All web apps collect data, process it, and return something
- Now I see how the whole "input → function → output" cycle works



📅 Day 3 - Logic Journal

✅ What I built:
- Login/Register App using Flask sessions

🔍 What logic I saw:
- Forms collect username/password
- Server checks credentials
- Sessions keep user logged in
- Logout clears session

🧠 Why this matters:
- Every app needs login
- Now I understand how “remember me” works using sessions
